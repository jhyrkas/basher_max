# basher_max

This repository contains code to build basher_cb and whacker_cb externals for Max/MSP.
These objects operate on lists of frequency/amplitude pairs and reduce or increase roughness based on user parameterization.
Two example patches are provided for testing purposes.

To build, put this folder in $USER/Documents/Max 8/Packages/max-sdk/source/\<something\>/

Do the Cmake build, make sure to check instructions for 8.2 and building for M1 arch...
https://github.com/Cycling74/max-sdk/blob/main/README-8.2-update.md

Slightly more detailed README with website links, paper links and more detailed instructions is forthcoming.
